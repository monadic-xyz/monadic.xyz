    <h2>Data &amp; Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Monadic GmbH is the creator behind the projects Radicle (radicle.xyz) and Open Source Coin (oscoin.io). We take
      our user’s data and privacy seriously - and are committed to protecting the rights of our users.
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy applies to all of our processing activities where we act as a data controller. In this policy, "we,"
      "us," and "our" refers to Monadic GmbH, a company incorporated in Germany with its registered address at
      Pücklerstraße 17, 10997 Berlin. For more information about us, see the Imprint or the “Contact Us” section of this
      policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may make changes to this policy every so often. When we do, we will change the “Last edited” date at the top of
      the page. We encourage you to review this policy regularly in order to stay informed about our information
      practices. If you do not agree to the revised policy, you should discontinue your use of our software and
      communities, as well as unsubscribe from our newsletter.
    </p>

    <h3>Data in a P2P Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
      In Radicle, all code that you host on the network can be considered public. Because any contributions on the
      network is linked to a public key, all contributions can be verified as coming from a public key. If your public
      key is linked to personally identifiable information, like your git username or email, this information will also
      be publicly accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      IPFS is the peer-to-peer infrastructure on which users build Radicle programs. Any data you send may be replicated
      to an indeterminate number of computers. This data can only be deleted or edited on a per-computer basis. Radicle
      State Machine updates are written as IPFS objects, using IPLD to link between these IPFS objects, and lastly we
      use IPNS to give us persistent identifiers for RSMs that resolve to the current state.
    </p>
    <p>
      We make this clear when we state in our documentation: “Radicle does not explicitly support private collaboration.
      All data, projects, and peer-to-peer communication is publicly available on the IPFS network to anyone who knows
      your project ID.” You can find more about this process within our documentation: <a
        href="http://radicle.xyz/docs/index.html#faq" target="_blank">Radicle FAQ</a>.

      (including your git username and, potentially, you email address if it’s associated with your git username) is
      written to a blockchain, which means that it may be transferred and stored around the world.
    </p>


    <h3>User Rights Under GDPR</h3>
    <p>
      At Monadic, we take user rights and privacy seriously - and this philosophy is built into each one of our
      projects. We have limited the data collected to the absolute minimum we need to enable the projects to work for
      the user, while preserving their anonymity. Our third party service providers assure us that they take the
      appropriate security measures to prevent access to our newsletter subscriber list for any purpose other than our
      purpose of using it to inform supporters of our projects’ progress.

          Friedrichstr. 219 </br>
          10969 Berlin </br>

    <p>
      However, as IPFS is the peer-to-peer infrastructure on which users build Radicle programs, the deletion or editing
      of any contributions you make to your or other repositories on the network cannot be fully enforced. This is
      because IPFS is a decentralized network and it stores data committed to it (like Radicle State Machines, which
      Radicle users write to collaborate in the Radicle network) around the world. We can only ensure that data that is
      held by Monadic is permanently deleted.
