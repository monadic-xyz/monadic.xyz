        replication models, and asymmetric cryptography. Our goal is to provide a foundation for collaboration within
        the
        Free and Open Source Software community, which is owned by the community itself. As part of the Radicle
        ecosystem,
        higher-level applications and protocols will be building on our work.

      <h2>Product Designer</h2>
      <h3>The task</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, we’re hiring a second product designer to work with Julien to design the application that will serve
        as the interface to the code collaboration protocol. Due to the complexity of the peer-to-peer and crypto space,
        the
        product team regularly faces uncertainty and moving targets. This means that we do a lot of our product thinking
        through frequent conversations and feedback, often readjusting our assumptions. We’re looking for an
        independent, driven designer who will engage in and question our product thinking, but focus on visual &
        interaction design.
      </p>
      <h3>You will</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>own the design system and visual direction of the product, while contributing to overall product strategy
          and decision-making</li>
        <li>create flows, prototypes, and high-fidelity visuals for new features</li>
        <li>design features that ship quickly, with high quality</li>
        <li>liaise closely with community, product & engineering teams to achieve the best possible results</li>
        <li>be able to have fun with our brand and create a bunch of swag</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>We are looking for someone who has</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>strong visual design language</li>
        <li>effective written and verbal communication skills</li>
        <li>ability to think through complex interaction design</li>
        <li>ability to express ideas through prototyping and/or code</li>
        <li>creative thinking skills and a real passion for design</li>
      </ul>
