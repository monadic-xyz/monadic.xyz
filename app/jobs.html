      but these revolve principally around how we treat each other and what
      standards we try to meet.</p>

      <a href="http://radicle.xyz">radicle</a>, our peer-to-peer stack for code
      collaboration. Knowledge of either rust or haskell is highly desired.  Since this is
      mostly protocol work, a background in network or systems programming is required.</p>

      <p>You will have to keep up to date with recent developments in the field; the
      ability to read research papers and produce working implementations is
      essential. You will have to be an excellent communicator.</p>

      and value exchange in free and open-source software communities.

      <p>Knowledge of rust is required, as well as experience working with blockchain
      technologies at the protocol level. You will be tasked to build and
      deploy fault-tolerant distributed systems based on cryptographic proofs,
      authenticated data-structures and distributed-ledger technologies.</p>

      <p>You will have to keep up to date with recent developments in the field; the
      ability to read research papers and produce working implementations is
      essential. You will have to be an excellent communicator.</p>
