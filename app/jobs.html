      <h2>
        Software Engineer on Code Collaboration
      </h2>
      <h3>The Task</h3>
      <p>
        The Radicle Code Collaboration project is building a protocol for decentralised, peer-to-peer code sharing and
        collaboration. We research and work with distributed version control systems, peer-to-peer network protocols,
        data
        replication models, and asymmetric cryptography. Our goal is to provide a foundation for collaboration within
        the
        Free and Open Source Software community, which is owned by the community itself. As part of the Radicle
        ecosystem,
        higher-level applications and protocols will be building on our work.
      </p>
      <h3>You should have</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>excellent oral and written communication skills</li>
        <li>an enthusiasm for open source software and collaboration more generally</li>
        <li>proficiency in Haskell and/or Rust (contributions to projects a big plus!)</li>
        <li>enjoyment from designing and iterating on APIs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>You should also have at least one of the following</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>experience with distributed systems and peer-to-peer technology</li>
        <li>experience working with the internals of VCSs such as Git, Pijul, Darcs</li>

        <li>knowledge of cryptography</li>
        <li>experience with network and systems programming</li>

      <h2>Software Engineer on Application</h2>
      <h3>The Task</h3>
      <p>
        The Application project brings together our work on p2p code collaboration and the incentivization layer into
        one high-level, end-user experience. On the Application team, you will design client libraries for protocols
        based on p2p and blockchain technologies and integrate them into production-ready binaries to be used by a cross
        platform end-user application.
      </p>

      <h2>Product Designer</h2>
      <h3>The Task</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, we’re hiring a second product designer to help Julien design the application that will serve as the
        interface to the code collaboration protocol. Due to the complexity of the peer-to-peer and crypto space, the
        product team regularly faces uncertainty and moving targets. This means that we do a lot of our product thinking
        through frequent conversations and feedback, often readjusting our assumptions. We’re looking for an
        independent, driven designer who will engage in and question our product thinking, but focus on visual &
        interaction design.
      </p>
      <h3>You will</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>own the design system and visual direction of the product, while contributing to overall product strategy
          and decision-making</li>
        <li>create flows, prototypes, and high-fidelity visuals for new features</li>
        <li>design features that ship quickly, with high quality</li>
        <li>liaise closely with community, product & engineering teams to achieve the best possible results</li>
        <li>be able to have fun with our brand and create a bunch of swag</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>You should have</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>strong visual design language</li>
        <li>effective written and verbal communication skills</li>
        <li>ability to think through complex interaction design</li>
        <li>ability to express ideas through prototyping and/or code</li>
        <li>creative thinking skills and a real passion for design</li>
      </ul>
